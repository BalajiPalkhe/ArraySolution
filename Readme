#ArraySolver

This whole project is based on Basics of Array and Oops concept.

In the project I implemented concepts of data types, conditional statements, loops, Oops Concept and Array.
Till the date what I learned that I have implement in this project #ArraySolver.

I used If Else condition to perform task based on user input and username password verification.

Used Scanner class to take inputs from the user.

While loop used to keep in that loop till user not logged out of the system.

used interface to declare abstract methods required for the project.

Encapsulation used for the confidential data(username and password) and then accessed by using #getters i.e Read Only 

 



Project Description:-
